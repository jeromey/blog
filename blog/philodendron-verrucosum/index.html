<h1>Philodendron Verrucosum Care: Keep this tricky plant thriving</h1>

<h2>Plant Background</h2>
<p>Philodendron verrucosum is a stunning houseplant with large, striking leaves that make it a favorite among plant enthusiasts. Native to South America, this plant is well adapted to the warm, humid environments of the region. In this post, we'll go over some tips for caring for your Philodendron verrucosum so that it can thrive in your home.</p>
<p>Philodendron verrucosum is native to the rainforests of South America, specifically in countries like Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It's found growing as an epiphyte, which means it grows on other plants, like trees. This plant is well adapted to the warm and humid conditions of the rainforest, so it's important to recreate those conditions as closely as possible in your home.</p>

<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<p>The Verrucosum has very striking colouring. Juvenille growth tends to be lighter and more neon. As the plant matures new leaves tend to be deeper in colour.</p>
<p>You'll either love it or hate it. The verrucosum has furry petiols (stems)</p>

<h2>Lighting Requirements</h2>
<p>Philodendron verrucosum does best in bright, indirect light. It can handle a bit of direct sunlight in the morning or late afternoon, but direct sun can scorch its leaves. If you don't have a spot in your home that gets enough natural light, you can use a grow light to provide your plant with the light it needs.</p>
<h2>Soil and Fertilisation Requirements</h2>
<p>When it comes to soil, Philodendron verrucosum prefers a loose, well-draining mix that holds moisture but doesn't stay soggy. You can use a mixture of potting soil, peat moss, and perlite for a good blend. Fertilize your plant once a month during the growing season with a balanced liquid fertilizer.</p>
<h2>Watering</h2>
<p>Philodendron verrucosum likes to stay evenly moist, but it doesn't like to sit in water. Water your plant when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Make sure to water it thoroughly, so the water drains out of the bottom of the pot.Philodendron verrucosum likes to stay evenly moist, but it doesn't like to sit in water. Water your plant when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Make sure to water it thoroughly, so the water drains out of the bottom of the pot. Additionally, since Philodendron verrucosum is adapted to the humid conditions of the rainforest, it can benefit from a bit of extra humidity. You can increase humidity by placing a tray of water near the plant or by misting the leaves with a spray bottle. If you live in a particularly dry climate, you might want to consider using a humidifier to keep your plant happy and healthy.</p>
<h2>Common Pests and Issues</h2>
<p>Like many houseplants, Philodendron verrucosum can be susceptible to pests like spider mites and mealybugs. Check your plant regularly for signs of infestation, like webbing or sticky residue on the leaves. If you do find pests, treat them with an insecticidal soap or neem oil.</p>
<h2>Propagation</h2>
<p>Philodendron verrucosum can be propagated from stem cuttings. Cut a stem with a few leaves and a node (the spot where a leaf meets the stem). Place the cutting in water until roots form, then plant it in soil.</p> 
<h2>Consider a Grow Tent or IKEA Greenhouse</h2>
<p>If you live in an area with dry air or cold temperatures, you might want to consider using a grow tent or an IKEA greenhouse to create a more humid environment for your Philodendron verrucosum. These products can help your plant thrive and reduce the risk of common issues like brown tips on the leaves.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Philodendron verrucosum is a beautiful and relatively easy-to-care-for houseplant. By following these tips, you can keep your plant healthy and vibrant for years to come. Whether you're a seasoned plant parent or a beginner, this plant is sure to be a stunning addition to your home.</p>
